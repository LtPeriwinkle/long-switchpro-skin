# long-switchpro-skin
A long and not-very-tall switch controller skin for [retrospy/RetroSpy](https://github.com/retrospy/RetroSpy)
made so it will fit better on my stream layout. I use a white color key on the window capture with a high similarity level to get a
transparent background on stream.

To add it to RetroSpy, find the directory where its files are stored (C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\RetroSpy on my pc). From there, navigate into 
the skins folder, and to the switch-pro folder. Then, just delete the old files from that folder, and copy the files from this repo into it. Restart RetroSpy, choose switch pro in the startup window, and it should work.
